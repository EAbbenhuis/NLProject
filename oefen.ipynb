cant say theyre not beneficial in some capacity even if we reduce it down to them being intriguing and interesting for a lot of people also its objectively more ways to play the game meaning more content even if the inwards and outwards vehicles were somehow balanced in wws that doesnt really make up for how they essentially removed the fun of the bikes a bunch of them are now just reskinned karts and the others feel too unresponsive when drifting due to the awkward delay before the drift actually functions it genuinely feels like complete ass they could have buffed the karts instead id prefer an unbalanced game that is actually fun to play over a supposedly balanced one that had its soul removed remember thats also considering its even balanced in the first place we all know karts are better i think counting ctgp is a flawed way of justifying mkw being better especially when every game beyond mkds has modding on it i prefer to judge a game based on what i can actually get out of it as opposed to arbitrarily limiting the comparison just for the sake of being fair youre only doing this to make 8 appear better in a completely sterile environment which doesnt fully represent how people are actually interacting with the games think of it this way in order to even play mkwii online you now need to use a mod wiimmfi sure it can be achieved through a simple dns change in your wiis internet settings but it applies a mod to the game nonetheless if someone decides to use wiimmfi to access functions of the game that were otherwise removed are they not playing mario kart wii anymore this is why outright removing mods from the discussion is completely unrepresentative and unfair nobody is going oh boy time to load up stock mkw to play grand prix for the 10000th time mario kart has historically been a game you play with other people and since split screen gaming is long dead by now you kind of need wiimmfi to play with other people now mods count because you need them to make a fair comparison especially when they are required to even play in the first place the simple fact is that mario kart wii has more compelling content just because a lot of it happened to come from community efforts doesnt mean you have an excuse to completely ignore it you should instead be supportive of any mk8dx mods that come out since that would help make mk8dx a better game mkws item balance is not good youre lying to yourself of you think a game that is so based around shock that one player on each team has to go backwards for it first of all thats wars which i didnt really mention second even in that context just because the game is being played in an unintended manner doesnt necessarily mean that theres an imbalance if you want to say that the strategy is stupid fine thats your opinion but saying that the mere idea of bagging is immediately the cause for imbalance is a little strange to me people are also willingly choosing to play the game like this so its not like an allrun format wasnt possible when it comes to actual balance in worldwides or whatever else mk8 discourages frontrunning so badly that the people in 1st place often hit the brakes to prevent the people in the back from getting shockbullet in last place or whatever other broken combination happens as a result of double items so now instead of last place going backwards its first place slowing down thats arguably just as dumb right distancebased items are dumb obviously double items are way too chaotic because this heavily benefits the people in the back letting them catch up way easier allowing them to bring powerful lastplace items into the midpack or even the front sometimes some items like shells move faster and are now the size of a kart bananas hit harder coins are like a fake item box that cant hit people several items that didnt cause lag hits in wii now do so in 8 theres no indication as to when an opposing player has iframes the boo immediately appears with no way to react to it unlike how it worked in mkds its just a mess nearly every addition or change ended up making the game worse in some way countering shocks is far easier they literally removed the hud timer and removed the 1 item limit so now its nearly impossible to tell when a shock exists and when its probably about to occur at least in worldwides so you now basically get hit at random what even is the counter when youre given no info to think about use an item randomly in a race and pray that the shock happens at least in wii you could get a vague idea for common shock spots based on the timer or just through gamesense the fact that it appeared often but was regulated by several factors made it predictable now in 8 that predictability is mostly gone you have no idea when its going to happen plus the fact that a double shock can even occur in the game is like a crime against humanity or a triple shock  most items cannot be pulled twice they removed item limits across the board in 8 apart from a few specific exceptions wii has more strict item limits and item timers with the one main exception of the blue shell which is admittedly more common in wii due to no timer but it still has a 1 item limit item pulls are far more predictable as a result as well the distancebased items make it harder to discern what items youll get from a box in wii you just look at what place youre in when you touch the box in 8 you have to look at the minimap and memorize roughly how far away the person in 1st place needs to be from you before you touch that specific item set you need to do that rough memorization for every single item set in the entire game which most people dont have the patience to do not all tracks are the same size either so the minimaps are often scaled differently meaning its even more annoying to try and guess how far away 1st place actually is in terms of ingame distance mario kart 8 deluxe is clearly more unpredictable in many ways it annoys me to no end when people see this ignore it and just pin everything on but nostalgia or but mods dont count or some other absolutely stupid irrelevant idea its just nonsense excuses a pathetic attempt to

dk summit  los angeles laps x200b x200b excessively long explanations for all my nonconfirmed choices x200b  riverside park the mario kart tour iteration of this course is the second most creative adaptation of a gba track in that game only beaten out by boo lake the ending setpiece with the bridges caves and waterfall adds a lot of theming and verticality to this originally flat course and it would be a shame if that effort and creativity were to be locked away in tour forever unless an even more remarkable gba remake is added to tour between now and wave 4 then i cant imagine riverside park not getting in note the reason i swapped the placements for the gba and wii courses is because it would be quite jarring to go directly from the serene and pastoral amsterdam drift to the gigachad extreme dk summit additionally it would be odd to have a cinematic crowdpleaser course like dk summit as the second track of the wave instead of reserving it for later the simplicity and lesser known status of riverside park would make it much more suitable as the second course in that regard x200b  airship fortress like dk summit this course is a big crowd pleaser and its glowup in mario kart tour is practically begging to be included in the bcp because this is the only remaining ds slot i think airship fortress is practically inevitable any other ds course would simply be less desirable and would leave so many wishing airship fortress had made it in instead x200b  daisy cruiser with the knowledge that waluigi stadium will most likely be in wave 6 that leaves us with three unknown gcn selections it should be fairly obvious that two of those will be daisy cruiser and dino dino jungle as those ones are already in tour im not sure what the remaining unknown gcn track could be but im personally banking on bowsers castle and i believe it will be in wave 6 as sort of a surprise concerning wave 4 dino dino jungle in particular has very similar scenery to riverside park so if riverside park actually does end up being in that wave then the wave 4 gcn course will most likely be either daisy cruiser or that remaining unknown track again im guessing that the remaining gcn track will be bowsers castle which is more suitable for the final cup of the bcp and too visually similar to airship fortress so by process of elimination ive chosen daisy cruiser for this spot x200b  dk summit my decision to put this course here requires a lot of explanation so prepare to read a massive wall of text this placement of dk summit basically came down to two assumptions the snes course in wave 5 being vanilla lake and the wii course in wave 6 being rainbow road wii rainbow road being in wave 6 leaves us with two possibilities concerning where the other remaining wii courses  dk summit and koopa cape  will be placed well either have dk summit in wave 4 and koopa cape in wave 5 or the other way around then theres the assumption of a vanilla lake course being in wave 5 which ive concluded is the most likely scenario aside from that one poster in coconut mall seemingly confirming it the fact remains that almost any other snes course would be either redundant or weak were not getting another mario circuit because we already have one were not getting another donut plains not only because we already have one but also because it would be super weird to have both a donut plains in the mk8 art style and a donut plains in the tour art style in the same game together were not getting a ghost valley because we already have boo lake were probably not getting a koopa beach because those courses are simply too basic and starkly themed to pass off as engaging content were probably not getting a choco island because it would be too visually similar to wave 5s sunset wilds although its possible that sunset wilds could be moved to another wave thereby making a choco island course much more likely for wave 5 and were probably not getting a bowser castle because the gba bowser castles are already the token flat bowsers castle tracks in tour and if another one of those is added to the game then it will almost certainly be gba bowser castle 4 and not one of the snes ones the vanilla lake courses are basically the only snes tracks that would meet the standard of not being redundant while also not being completely lame unremarkable inclusions keep in mind that the body of water in vanilla lake 2 has a lot of potential for surprise course design they could create an entire underwater section out of it so what does wave 5s snes course have to do with the placement of dk summit well seeing as i believe wave 5 will feature one of the vanilla lake tracks i think it would be a bit ridiculous to release dk summit in wave 5 as well as that would mean two winterthemed courses in a summer wave one winterthemed course during the summer is fine enough especially if its very small and innocuous and either vanilla lake course certainly fits that description but two would just be weird so because im convinced that vanilla lake will be in wave 5 then im putting dk summit in wave 4 simply to avoid the unseasonable nature of having two winter courses release during the summer finally actually consider the boomerang cup with this arrangement singapore speedway daisy cruiser dk summit and los angeles laps that would simply be a killer selection of courses better than any of the current bcp cups in my opinion x200b  los angeles laps since we already know the placements of amsterdam singapore bangkok and vancouver los angeles is basically the only city course that makes any sense to be in this spot i cant really imagine nintendo announcing a new city course for tour releasing the first of its three routes in early 2023 and then porting the whole threeroute track over to mk8dx just two or three months later before the second route even comes to tour it would simply be a weird move in my opinion additionally the unique structure of los angeles laps makes it quite suitable to end wave 4 on',\n",

       "   'fruit cup  amsterdam drift  gba riverside park gba and wii placements swapped  ds airship fortress  new yoshis island course x200b boomerang cup  singapore speedway  gcn daisy cruiser  wii dk summit  los angeles laps x200b x200b excessively long explanations for all my nonconfirmed choices x200b  riverside park the mario kart tour iteration of this course is the second most creative adaptation of a gba track in that game only beaten out by boo lake the ending setpiece with the bridges caves and waterfall adds a lot of theming and verticality to this originally flat course and it would be a shame if that effort and creativity were to be locked away in tour forever unless an even more remarkable gba remake is added to tour between now and wave 4 then i cant imagine riverside park not getting in note the reason i swapped the placements for the gba and wii courses is because it would be quite jarring to go directly from the serene and pastoral amsterdam drift to the gigachad extreme dk summit additionally it would be odd to have a cinematic crowdpleaser course like dk summit as the second track of the wave instead of reserving it for later the simplicity and lesser known status of riverside park would make it much more suitable as the second course in that regard x200b  airship fortress like dk summit this course is a big crowd pleaser and its glowup in mario kart tour is practically begging to be included in the bcp because this is the only remaining ds slot i think airship fortress is practically inevitable any other ds course would simply be less desirable and would leave so many wishing airship fortress had made it in instead x200b  daisy cruiser with the knowledge that waluigi stadium will most likely be in wave 6 that leaves us with three unknown gcn selections it should be fairly obvious that two of those will be daisy cruiser and dino dino jungle as those ones are already in tour im not sure what the remaining unknown gcn track could be but im personally banking on bowsers castle and i believe it will be in wave 6 as sort of a surprise concerning wave 4 dino dino jungle in particular has very similar scenery to riverside park so if riverside park actually does end up being in that wave then the wave 4 gcn course will most likely be either daisy cruiser or that remaining unknown track again im guessing that the remaining gcn track will be bowsers castle which is more suitable for the final cup of the bcp and too visually similar to airship fortress so by process of elimination ive chosen daisy cruiser for this spot x200b  dk summit my decision to put this course here requires a lot of explanation so prepare to read a massive wall of text this placement of dk summit basically came down to two assumptions the snes course in wave 5 being vanilla lake and the wii course in wave 6 being rainbow road wii rainbow road being in wave 6 leaves us with two possibilities concerning where the other remaining wii courses  dk summit and koopa cape  will be placed well either have dk summit in wave 4 and koopa cape in wave 5 or the other way around then theres the assumption of a vanilla lake course being in wave 5 which ive concluded is the most likely scenario aside from that one poster in coconut mall seemingly confirming it the fact remains that almost any other snes course would be either redundant or weak were not getting another mario circuit because we already have one were not getting another donut plains not only because we already have one but also because it would be super weird to have both a donut plains in the mk8 art style and a donut plains in the tour art style in the same game together were not getting a ghost valley because we already have boo lake were probably not getting a koopa beach because those courses are simply too basic and starkly themed to pass off as engaging content were probably not getting a choco island because it would be too visually similar to wave 5s sunset wilds although its possible that sunset wilds could be moved to another wave thereby making a choco island course much more likely for wave 5 and were probably not getting a bowser castle because the gba bowser castles are already the token flat bowsers castle tracks in tour and if another one of those is added to the game then it will almost certainly be gba bowser castle 4 and not one of the snes ones the vanilla lake courses are basically the only snes tracks that would meet the standard of not being redundant while also not being completely lame unremarkable inclusions keep in mind that the body of water in vanilla lake 2 has a lot of potential for surprise course design they could create an entire underwater section out of it so what does wave 5s snes course have to do with the placement of dk summit well seeing as i believe wave 5 will feature one of the vanilla lake tracks i think it would be a bit ridiculous to release dk summit in wave 5 as well as that would mean two winterthemed courses in a summer wave one winterthemed course during the summer is fine enough especially if its very small and innocuous and either vanilla lake course certainly fits that description but two would just be weird so because im convinced that vanilla lake will be in wave 5 then im putting dk summit in wave 4 simply to avoid the unseasonable nature of having two winter courses release during the summer finally actually consider the boomerang cup with this arrangement singapore speedway daisy cruiser dk summit and los angeles laps that would simply be a killer selection of courses better than any of the current bcp cups in my opinion x200b  los angeles laps since we already know the placements of amsterdam singapore bangkok and vancouver los angeles is basically the only city course that makes any sense to be in this spot i cant really imagine nintendo announcing a new city course for tour releasing the first of its three routes in early 2023 and then porting the whole threeroute track over to mk8dx just two or three months later before the second route even comes to tour it would simply be a weird move in my opinion additionally the unique structure of los angeles laps makes it quite suitable to end wave 4 on',\n",

       "   'idk this doesnt look that unusual to me to everyone saying its lag its not even that its just a tad bit of desync theres a difference they definitely got protection from the first of your initial three reds got hit by the second one and got invincibility frames against the third and fourth one and then the last red on the bridge they definitely had protection for you can see the little chunks of green shell on the last one as well plus you 100 would have caught up to them more if you took better lines around the turns as inherently you have a faster combo for this map cause of the leaf tires you should have stuck much closer behind them cause you knew they didnt have any items gotten a draft hit the final double item for protection and then just driven to the win granted its all in the past so what im saying doesnt really matter but still you can break away super fast on mario circuit if you know what youre doing and that ludwig clearly just knows what theyre doing',\n",
